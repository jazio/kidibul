## Working with text files.

Files contains the information you want to keep: text, images,videos, programs.


Now create a file:

```
$ touch hello
```

You created a file with the name 'hello'

Push some text into it:

```
$ echo "Hello world!" > hello
```


Check if text is there, in the file:

```
$ cat hello
```

Hint: type only `cat RE` then hit <TAB> on your keyboard. 

You can add text

Now open your favorite editor (Sublime Text)
```
$ subl README
```

And add the following text:

```
My name is <Your Name>
```

The go to menu File > Save.

Return to your console.

Now let's duplicate the file:
The command cp (copy) will copy the file 'echo' into a file with name 'README'.

```
$ cp hello README 
```

Hint: Linux is case-sensitive, it means README is not the same with readme.

Now you have 2 files.

Delete file `hello`

```
$ rm echo
```


Other editors: vim, nano.
